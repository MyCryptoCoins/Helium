## What is Heliumcoin?

HeliumCoin is a new crypto-currency, freely available globally. It is based on a peer-to-peer network protocol that allows people to store, place transactions and earn substantial interest on investment (PoS) with a focus on high performance, longevity and adoption by services. This means that any user holding coins will receive interest on their balance in return for their help in the maintenance of the system (network).

HeliumCoin offers you a real alternative to the actual centralized banks, and you are in control of, and are responsible for, all your funds. Built on the foundation of BitCoin, PPCoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as Proof of Stake help further advance the field of crypto-currency, and provides a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
